## **About this Course:**

A data product is the production output from a statistical analysis. Data products automate complex analysis tasks or use technology to expand the utility of a data informed model, algorithm or inference. This course covered the basics of creating data products using Shiny, R packages, and interactive graphics. The course focused on the statistical fundamentals of creating a data product that can be used to tell a story about data to a mass audience.
