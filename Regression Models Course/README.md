## **About this course:**

Linear models, as their name implies, relates an outcome to a set of predictors of interest using linear assumptions. Regression models, a subset of linear models, are the most important statistical analysis tool in a data scientist’s toolkit. This course covered regression analysis, least squares and inference using regression models. Special cases of the regression model, ANOVA and ANCOVA were covered as well. Analysis of residuals and variability were investigated. The course covered modern thinking on model selection and novel uses of regression models including scatterplot smoothing.
