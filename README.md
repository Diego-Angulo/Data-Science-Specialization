# Data Science Specialization
**Jhons Hopkins University - On Coursera**

This repository contains my **R Markdown** files from the course projects from the Johns Hopkins University Data Science Specialization on Coursera.

## **About this specialization:**

This Specialization covers the concepts and tools needed throughout the entire data science pipeline, from asking the right kinds of questions to making inferences and publishing results. At completion, students have a portfolio demonstrating their mastery of the material.

**There are 10 Courses in this Specialization:**

1.  The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox
2.  R Programming 
3.  Getting and Cleaning Data
4.  Exploratory Data Analysis
5.  Reproducible Research
6.  Statistical Inference
7.  Regression Models
8.  Practical Machine Learning
9.  Developing Data Products
10. Data Science Capstone

Although, this is a ten-course specialization. I did not upload any files from the first 4 courses because their projects are
just an introduction to the further courses.
