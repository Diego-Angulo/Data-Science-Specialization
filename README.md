# Data Science Specialization
Jhons Hopkins University - On Coursera

This repository contains all of my project's files from the Jhons Hopkins University Data Science Specializacion on Coursera.

There are 10 Courses in this Specialization:

1.  The Data Scientistâ€™s Toolbox
2.  R Programming 
3.  Getting and Cleaning Data
4.  Exploratory Data Analysis
5.  Reproducible Research
6.  Statistical Inference
7.  Regression Models
8.  Practical Machine Learning
9.  Developing Data Products
10. Data Science Capstone

Although, this is a ten-course specialization. I did not upload any files from the first 4 courses because their projects are
just an introduction to the further courses. 

All my final projects are also uploaded in Rpubs. You can find them here: https://rpubs.com/diegolas <br/>
The final project of the ninth course is a ShinyApp. You can also find it here: https://diegoangulo.shinyapps.io/regressionapp/
